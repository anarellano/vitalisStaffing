          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            In 2022, fueled by an unwavering passion for justice and an
            unyielding commitment to fairness, Raquel and Justine embarked on a
            transformative journey. Together, they founded Vitalis Staffing,
            driven by a shared mission to address the pressing issues of pay
            inequality, lack of flexibility, and mistreatment faced by medical
            professionals. Today, our hearts beat with determination as we
            extend our fight, united in our unwavering dedication to empower
            nurses across California and create a future where justice, respect,
            and equity reign. Join us on this heartfelt journey as we champion
            your rights, stand tall in solidarity, and work hand in hand to
            build a stronger, more compassionate, and truly equitable healthcare
            system.

              In the vast sea of medical staffing, many agencies prioritize
              bottom lines over genuine care. They often leave nurses feeling
              undervalued and overworked. This approach doesn't just harm
              healthcare professionals, but it also impacts the quality of
              patient care. At Vitalis Staffing, we've flipped the script. We
              believe in putting our nurses first, knowing that their well-being
              translates to unparalleled patient care. With us, you're not just
              another number; you're family.
